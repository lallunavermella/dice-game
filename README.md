# Dice Game with Redux Toolkit ðŸŽ²

This is a simple web application built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Redux Toolkit. The purpose of this project is to test and showcase the usage of Redux Toolkit, a powerful toolset for managing state in Redux applications. The game consists of rolling a dice and advancing through a board with different rules based on the dice result.

## How to Play

1. Click on the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice.
2. Depending on the dice result, you will advance on the board following these rules:
   - If you roll a number between 1 and 2, you will advance 1 position.
   - If you roll a number between 3 and 4, you will advance 3 positions.
   - If you roll a number greater than 4, you will advance 5 positions.
